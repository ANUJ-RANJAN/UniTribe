Inspiration
We were inspired by the struggle of students going to events and trips alone as well as the difficulty of student finding their community, especially for international students who are away form home.

What it does
This website will advertise events and trips allowing people to join them if they are interested. There are also a community of like-minded people for students to meet. This is shown through a map to allow users for better visualisation and configuration based on location.

How we built it
This project was built using react and tailwind for the frontend and firebase for the backend for seamless integration.

Challenges we ran into
The group was not very experienced with the techstack and therefore the challenge of learning and developing simultaneously was particularly difficult.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integration with map. Connection with Database.

What we learned
The group learned new technologies to enhance their skills as well as the process of quick development and prototyping.

What's next for Unitribe
Allowing people to share their story through uploading their videos and photos
